## Introduction
Yo, I'm Kevin. I made Mosu. Let me tell you why.

Here's a non-exhaustive list of job boards:
1. LinkedIn
2. Craigslist
3. Hired
4. Glassdoor
5. Dice
6. AngelList
7. Indeed

Let's stop here. That's already 7 personal profiles you have to fill out. 7 different interfaces to learn, 7 apps on your phone.

In a way, this is a necessary evil. Each job board has its own quirks; each has its own pool of unique job posters and job seekers. Scouring every site is a good - and relatively easy - way to see what's out there. But it still fucken sucks.

That's why I made Mosu.

**Mosu helps you keep track of job listings from different job boards.** It also has some other features, like listing basic requirements every developer should know. It also maps the popularity of different technologies based on location.
